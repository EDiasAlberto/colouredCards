This is a simple game. Each round both players draw a card. Similar to rock paper scissors, red>black, yellow>red, black>yellow.
If both cards are the same colour, the one with the higher number wins.
The winner of each round gets both cards.
This continues until there are no more cards left.
At the end of the game, the person with the most cards wins.
